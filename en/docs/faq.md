# FAQ

## Q. If I enter Ctrl+S during interactive jobs, I cannot enter keys after that

This is because standard terminal emulators for macOS, Windows, and Linux have Ctrl+S/Ctrl+Q flow control enabled by default. To disable it, execute the following in the terminal emulator of the local PC:

```shell
$ stty -ixon
```

Executing while logged in to the interactive node has the same effect.

## Q. The group area is consumed more than the actual size

Generally, any file systems have their own block size, and even the smallest file consumes the capacity of the block size.

ABCI sets the block size of the group area to 128 KB and the block size of the home area to 4 KB. For this reason, if a large number of small files are created in the group area, usage efficiency will be reduced. For example, if you want to create a file that is less than 4KB in the group area, you need about 32 times the capacity of the home area.

## Q. Singularity cannot use container registries that require authentication

Singularity version 2.6 has a function equivalent to ``docker login`` that provides authentication information with environment variables.

```shell
[username@es ~]$ export SINGULARITY_DOCKER_USERNAME='username'
[username@es ~]$ export SINGULARITY_DOCKER_PASSWORD='password'
[username@es ~]$ singularity pull docker://myregistry.azurecr.io/namespace/repo_name:repo_tag
```

For more information on Singularity version 2.6 authentication, see below.

## Q. NGC CLI cannot be executed

When running [NGC Catalog CLI](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-catalog-cli-user-guide/index.html) on ABCI, the following error message appears and execution is not possible. This is because the NGC CLI is built for Ubuntu 14.04 and later.

```
ImportError: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.18' not found (required by /tmp/_MEIxvHq8h/libstdc++.so.6)
[89261] Failed to execute script ngc
```

By preparing the following shell script, it can be executed using Singularity. This technique can be used not only for NGC CLI but also for general use.

```
#!/bin/sh
source /etc/profile.d/modules.sh
module load singularity/2.6.1

NGC_HOME=$HOME/ngc
singularity exec $NGC_HOME/ubuntu-18.04.simg $NGC_HOME/ngc $@
```

## Q. I want to assign multiple compute nodes and have each compute node perform different processing

If you give `-l rt_F=N` option to `qrsh` or `qsub`, you can assign N compute nodes. You can also use MPI if you want to perform different processing on each assigned compute node.

```
$ module load openmpi/2.1.6
$ mpirun -hostfile $SGE_JOB_HOSTLIST -np 1 command1 : -np 1 command2 : ... : -np1 commandN
```

## Q. I want to avoid to close SSH session unexpectedly 

The SSH session may be closed shortly after connecting to ABCI with SSH. In such a case, you may be able to avoid it by performing KeepAlive communication between the SSH client and the server.

To enable KeepAlive, set the option ServerAliveInterval to about 60 seconds in the system ssh configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config) or per-user configuration file (~/.ssh/config) on the user's terminal.
```
[username@yourpc ~]$ vi ~/.ssh/config
[username@yourpc ~]$ cat ~/.ssh/config
(snip)
Host as.abci.ai
   ServerAliveInterval 60
(snip)
[username@userpc ~]$
```

!!! note
    The default value of ServerAliveInterval is 0 (no KeepAlive)..
