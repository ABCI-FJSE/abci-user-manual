# Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is a convenient tool that allows you to write code and get the results while creating a document on the browser. This document describes how to start Jupyter Notebook on ABCI and use it from your PC browser.

## Using Pip Install

This part explains how to install and use Jupyter Notebook with pip.

### Install by Pip

First, you need to occupy one compute node, create a Python virtual environment, and install `tensorflow-gpu` and` jupyter` with `pip`.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrsh -g grpname -l rt_F=1
[username@g0001 ~]$ module load python/3.6/3.6.5 cuda/10.0/10.0.130.1 cudnn/7.4/7.4.2
[username@g0001 ~]$ python3 -m venv ~/jupyter_env
[username@g0001 ~]$ source ~/jupyter_env/bin/activate
(jupyter_env) [username@g0001 ~]$ pip3 install tensorflow-gpu jupyter numpy==1.16.4
```

!!! note
    In this example, `tensorflow-gpu` and` jupyter` are installed into `~/jupyter_env` directory.


From the next time on, you only need to load modules and activate `~/jupyter_env` as shown below.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrsh -g grpname -l rt_F=1
[username@g0001 ~]$ module load python/3.6/3.6.5 cuda/10.0/10.0.130.1 cudnn/7.4/7.4.2
[username@g0001 ~]$ source ~/jupyter_env/bin/activate
```

!!! note
    If you need other modules besides CUDA and cuDNN, you need to load them before starting Jupyter Notebook as well.

### Start Jupyter Notebook

Confirm the host name of the compute node as you will need it later.

```
(jupyter_env) [username@g0001 ~]$ hostname
g0001.abci.local
```

Next, start Jupyter Notebook as follows:

<div class="codehilite"><pre>
(jupyter_env) [username@g0001 ~]$ jupyter notebook --ip=`hostname` --port=8888 --no-browser
:
(snip)
:
[I 20:41:12.082 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
[C 20:41:12.090 NotebookApp]

    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/username/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-xxxxxx-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://g0001.abci.local:8888/?token=<i>token_string</i>
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=<i>token_string</i>
</pre></div>

### Generate an SSH tunnel

Assume that the local PC port 100022 has been transferred to the interactive node (*es*) according to the procedure in [Login using an SSH Client::General method](../02.md#general-method) in ABCI System User Environment.

Next, create an SSH tunnel that forwards port 8888 on the local PC to port 8888 on the compute node. For "*g0001*", specify the host name of the compute node confirmed when starting Jupyter Notebook.

<div class="codehilite"><pre>
[yourpc ~]$ ssh -N -L 8888:<i>g0001</i>:8888 -l username -i /path/identity_file -p 10022 localhost
</pre></div>

### Connect to Jupyter Notebook

Open the following URL in a browser. For "*token_string*", specify the one displayed when starting Jupyter Notebook.

<div class="codehilite"><pre>
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=<i>token_string</i>
</pre></div>

To check the operation, when the dashboard screen of Jupyter Notebook is displayed in the browser, create a new Python3 Notebook from the `New` button and execute it as follows.

```
import tensorflow
print(tensorflow.__version__)
print(tensorflow.test.is_gpu_available())
```

``is_gpu_available()`` also returns False if it cannot recognize the cuDNN library.

For how to use Jupyter Notebook, please see the [Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html).

### Terminate Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook will be terminated by the following steps:

* (Local PC) Exit with the `Quit` button on the dashboard screen
* (Local PC) Press `Control-C` and terminate SSH tunnel connection that was forwarding port 8888
* (Compute Node) If `jupyter` program is not finished, quit with `Control-C`

## Using Singularity

Instead of installing pip, you can also use a container image with Jupyter Notebook installed. For example, the TensorFlow Docker image provided in [NGC](../ngc.md) has Jupyter Notebook installed as well as TensorFlow.

### Build a container image

Get the container image. Here, the Docker image (``nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:19.07-py3``) provided by NGC is used.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ module load singularity/2.6.1
[username@es1 ~]$ singularity pull docker://nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:19.07-py3
Docker image path: nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:19.07-py3
Cache folder set to /home/username/.singularity/docker
Importing: base Singularity environment

Singularity container built: ./tensorflow-19.07-py3.simg
Cleaning up...

```

### Start Jupyter Notebook

First, you need to occupy one compute node. And, confirm the host name of the compute node as you will need it later.

```
[username@es1 ~]$ qrsh -g grpname -l rt_F=1
[username@g0001 ~]$ hostname
g0001.abci.local
```

Next, start Jupyter Notebook in the container image as shown below:

<div class="codehilite"><pre>
[username@g0001 ~]$ module load singularity/2.6.1
[username@g0001 ~]$ singularity run --nv ./tensorflow-19.07-py3.simg jupyter notebook --ip=`hostname` --port=8888 --no-browser
